## Starting Again

## Version Control

GitHub and git are tools I have been using for data projects and programming for some time. They are tools that allow documented version control. I can create "branches" for experimenting, make changes on the website in that "branch" - and either abandon or accept those changes depending on whether they work. GitHub allows projects to be made open source and shared with other developers. While this infrastructure was developed for programming - I have found it to be an interesting experience completing "coursework" using this framework. I have every stage of development of this project documented, which makes it easy to look back and reflect upon the work. 

<span> 
    <div>
        <img height="400px" width="500px" src={branches}/> 
    </div>

<span> 
    <div style={{float: "left"}}>
        <img height="400px" width="500px" src={modalv1a}/> 
    </div>
</span>

<span> 
    <div style={{float: "right"}}>
        <img height="400px" width="500px" src={modalv1b}/> 
    </div>
</span>

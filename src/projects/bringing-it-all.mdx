<ul class='arrow-list-style'>
    <li>I have designed the portfolio to be interactive without too much navigation. Aside from projects that cannot be embedded, most content does not require leaving the site.</li> 
    <li>The data backend I developed requires a description, reflection, and connection. While there is always room for improvement - I believe the projects are well connected to my goals and intentions.</li>
    <li>free website tools all start to look the same, and may not work well for a portfolio that is meant to be continually developed</li>
</ul>

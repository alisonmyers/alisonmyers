          <p>
          The metaphor that I have chosen is the process of creating a piece of art: from a sketchbook to the final art piece. The metaphor is appropriate for my MET journey as I haven’t felt like it has been a linear path, and I wanted a metaphor that could reflect the iteration and understanding that has occurred through different courses. Important concepts might have started as a doodle or sketch, but through different courses the ideas became more clear. I picked up various “techniques” (technologies, methods of learning) throughout the program that I am now more comfortable using.

// Step 1: Import React and Link

import Layout from '../components/my-layout';
import CourseTimeLine from '../components/courses';
import GoalsHtml from '../components/goals';
import PDFViewer from '../components/pdf-viewer';

      <div class="pdf-container"> 
        <PDFViewer backend={PDFJSBackend} src="/pdf.pdf"

        <h3>Hello, and welcome to my ePortfolio! </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>The purpose of my ePortfolio is to make connections between the courses I have taken throughout the program in order to ensure I have a deeper understanding of the concepts that will be valuable for future endeavours. Throughout the development of the ePortfolio I expect to revisit concepts and course work in order to make connections between the work I have completed. With this deeper understanding and more connections, I hope to review and revise the work I have completed - either through rewriting or reformatting the work using different mediums that best communicates what I have learned.</p> 
        
      <p>Another outcome is to demonstrate what I have learned about technology use and adoption, in part through the development of the ePortfolio itself. I would like this ePortfolio to be flexible, and useful beyond the MET program. To ensure this, I will build the ePortfolio in a way that is sustainable and can act as a professional portfolio of more technical work in the future. To this end, I hope to learn and apply modern web development techniques. </p>
      
      <p>The audience that best aligns with my outcomes and purpose for the ePortfolio are: myself (making connections, ensuring deeper learning, developing an ePortfolio that is flexible and sustainable), and potential future employers.</p>

      <h3>Exploring the ePortfolio</h3>
      <p> This portfolio is designed to showcase learning, reflection, and artifacts that have taken place throughout my MET journey. Each of my goals and artifacts are dynamically tagged with icons to make connections between them. You will see highlighted text which indicates the abilility to hover for more information. </p>

      <div class="todo-card">
      <h3>WIP</h3>
        <p>You'll notice some incomplete sections so far, but here are my plans:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1. Add highlighters / more information icons (and reduce text, so the user has the option of what they want to learn more about</li>
          <li>2. Make icons "clickable" - right now many icons are static, but they should actually provide more information when interacted with (see 1.)</li>
          <li>3. Add portfolio projects! (i.e. artifacts). I have been designing the portfolio so that I can dynamically add projects into a folder, and the summary and unique pages will be created. I need to add a "template" for this to work so that I can also add reflections and artifacts.</li>
        </ul>
